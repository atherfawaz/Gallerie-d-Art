5=!=!=Chokha=!=!=Maharana Bhim Singh of Udaipur (r. 1778-1828) Returns from a Boar Hunt=!=!=This painting characterizes the grandeur associated with the hunting procession in the early nineteenth century. A haloed maharana Bhim Singh returns after a boar hunt with his attendants and retinue. The king holds a gold spear and wears a green jama associated with the aheria, or spring hunt, when boars are hunted in Rajasthan. The maharana also carries a gold lance, while a sword and punch dagger are attached to his patka (sash). The ruler sits on an ornately decorated horse, while the large hunting party is on foot. The attendants carry the necessary royal attributes: two attendants carry fly whisks while one holds a sun-faced standard, a symbol of the Mewar family who are conceived of as descendants of the sun. This standard accompanies the royal procession at all times. For the pleasure of the king, another attendant carries a gold hookah. Saluki hounds and falcons were frequently employed in medieval Indian game hunts. Wild boars slain during the expedition are strapped on the backs of the camels, symbolizing that the aheria was successful. In the Hindu tradition, the king's bountiful catch foretold that the kingdom could expect a fruitful year ahead.

18=!=!=Jean-Baptiste Oudry=!=!=A Game of Hot Cockles=!=!=The scene features a game of "hot cockles" (Fr. "la main chaude"). This game, which originated in the middle ages, involves a blindfolded person bent over with his head in the lap of a woman.  The other players slap him on the hand that is tucked behind his back, and he has to guess who it is. When the person guesses correctly who slapped him, that person takes his place. The game is depicted in a contemporary painting (1767-1773) by Fragonard (National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1946.7.6) which includes a similar garden setting. One stage of the tapestry's composition is preserved in a drawing by Oudry on blue paper (Stockholm National Museum, no. 2890 / I863).

36=!=!=Fung Ming Chip=!=!=Chan (Better known in English by the Japanese term "Zen")=!=!=This large, vertically oriented, rectangular album leaf is inscribed with a single character reading "Chan". The character, which is better known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation "Zen," refers to a meditative sect of Buddhism that claimed--and still claims--numerous adherents in both China and Japan. The text was composed and inscribed on this album leaf by Fung Ming Chip (standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The upper two thirds of this album leaf is blank except for the seal impressed at the very top; the lower one third includes several broad brushstrokes in black ink, the network of brushstrokes resembling two stacked Z's. Written upside down, as if reflected from above, the single character is written in cursive, or running, script (xingshu) in a manner that the artist characterizes as "reflection script." The artist created this calligraphic work by brushing the broad, black strokes and then, using a brush loaded with water, by inscribing the character within the upper portion of the net of brushstrokes, creating a work in which the character appears pale gray against the black strokes. The artist has stated that he intended to create a calligraphic work that resembles a pictorial, nighttime scene in which the moon--in this instance, the character chan--is reflected in a lake (i.e., the network of black brushstrokes at the bottom). This calligraphic work is not dated; however, the artist stated to the curator that he created it in 2009. This calligraphic work is not signed, but it includes one seal of the artist, which identifies it as a work of Fung Ming Chip. The seal, which the artist himself carved, can be described as follows:    Square, red, intaglio seal reading "Xiang"  [Note:  The seal reading "Xiang" can be translated as "Phenomenon"]    =!=!=Album leaf: ink on paper; with one seal of the artist=!=!=21st century=!=!=2019-05-07=!=!=59500=!=!=https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC111166_dynmc
37=!=!=Li Junyi [Chun-yi Lee]=!=!=Ten Thousand Years, Ten Thousand Years of Sleep, One Hundred Million Scattered Pieces=!=!=This triptych comprises a set of three hanging scrolls, each painted in ink on paper. The central scroll is a formal portrait of Mao Zedong (1893–1976); the flanking scrolls represent landscapes. The Mao portrait is based both on the official portrait photograph of Mao Zedong that was taken in 1959 by Xinhua News Agency photojournalists Meng Qingbiao (1925–1969) and Ho Bo (born 1924) and on the official portrait painting of Chairman Mao that that was created in 1959 by Zhang Zhenshi (1914–1992), a professor at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Beijing, based on the official portrait photograph. The portrait presents a bust-length, frontal portrait of Chairman Mao, his head and shoulders turned slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his proper right. His hair is combed straight back, his eyes are fully open, and his mouth suggests a slight smile. He wears a Mao jacket, buttoned all the way to the top; one circular button appears in the inverted “V” formed by the two downward-projecting points of the collar. Perhaps part of the Mao-jacket collar, perhaps the top of a collar of a shirt worn under the jacket, a slender white line encircles Chairman Mao’s neck, readily distinguishing garment from flesh. A circular black disc appears in the center of the otherwise unembellished white paper above Chairman Mao’s head. The background area of the portrait—but not the area above the portrait—are fully textured, so that the image of Chairman Mao emerges from a gray background. The characters that appear throughout the painting, both in the portrait of Chairman Mao and in the disc above—i.e., one character within each square of the grid—read Mao Ze Dong; arranged in random order, they also appear in random orientations, some right side up, others upside down, and yet others sideways. The “texturing characters” appear in the image of Mao, in the background areas, and in the disc above but are most evident in the background areas and in the disc. A long inscription comprising 180 characters appears in the rectangular border surrounding the painting. A narrow strip of unembellished white paper appears just inside the border, clearly differentiating border from portrait.    Each landscape scroll presents a view into a deep mountain valley that recedes distantly into the pictorial space. Each landscape is a bilaterally symmetrical rendition of the other, so that the landscapes are mirror images of each other. Appearing black and positioned at the “inside edge” of each landscape composition—i.e., on the side of the composition opposite from the blank grid square that is an “implied seal” (see description below)—a towering foreground peak partially blocks the view of the mountain range that rises on one side of the valley. Silhouetted against the receding valley, old pines grow around the periphery of the foreground peak and around the top of the shorter peak that accompanies it. When the landscape scrolls are hung on either side of the central scroll, the dark, foreground peaks frame the Mao portrait. A rectangular area of blank paper appears above each landscape, and a dark border frames each composition and the accompanying blank paper above, a narrow strip of unembellished white paper separating border from landscape, the arrangement echoing that of the central, portrait scroll.    The artist did the “original version” of this triptych in 1988 in fulfillment of requirements for his bachelor of arts degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The artist sold the Mao portrait from that set to Kingsley Liu, a Hong Kong collector of contemporary Chinese ink paintings; the artist still owns the two landscapes from the original set. The artist originally was thinking of simply painting a new Mao portrait, which he would pair with the existing, original landscape paintings (from 1988) for this set (which was commissioned twenty years after the original set; however, upon re-examining the landscape scrolls, which had been stored in Hong Kong, the artist discovered that they sustained water damaged while stored. Thus, the artist created an entirely new set in 2009.    The artist has stated that although this work is a triptych and although he would prefer that the scrolls be exhibited as a set, in fact, the scrolls may be exhibited in whichever arrangement or grouping that curators would like; thus, the scrolls may be shown individually, just as the two landscape scrolls may be exhibited as a pair (without the central portrait of Mao).    =!=!=Proper-right scroll of a set of three hanging scrolls forming a triptych; ink on paper; with artist's signature reading "Erlinglingjiu nian chun Li Junyi shi yu Meiguo Fenghuangcheng"=!=!=21st century=!=!=2019-05-07=!=!=42000=!=!=https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:766370

Executed in the so-called "blue-green" manner (an archaistic mode of painting that evokes the vibrant malachite-blue and azurite-green mineral pigments used by early Chinese painters to color natural scenery), the painting depicts several figures--probably scholars and servants, based on the dress and accoutrements carried--positioned alone or in pairs at various points in the landscape. Figures are shown meandering along mountain a paths, gazing at a waterfall or across calm waters, or quietly meditating while floating on a skiff. The poem that follows the painting was written a year later than the painting, but it makes elegant reference to the landscape imagery that precedes it.=!=!=Handscroll; the painting in ink and colors on silk, with signature of the artist reading "Jiajing gengyin qiyue siri; Zhengming xie", and with two seals of the artist reading "Zheng" and "Ming"; the calligraphy in ink on paper, with signature of the artist reading "Zhengming", and with two seals of the artist reading "Wen Zheng Ming Yin" and "Heng Shan".=!=!=16th century=!=!=2019-05-07=!=!=184000=!=!=https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:INV227762_dynmc

41=!=!=Ismail bin Ibrahim Bosnavi (calligrapher, d. 1748)=!=!=Calligraphic Portrait of the Prophet Muhammad, right-hand side of a bifolio from a manuscript=!=!=Copied in naskh script by Ismail Bosnavi, these two facing folios (2002.50.119 and 2002.50.135) contain a hilye (Arabic hilya), or calligraphically rendered description in Arabic of the Prophet Muhammad. The text of the hilye, attributed to Ali, the prophet’s cousin and son-in-law, describes both the physical qualities of the Prophet and his good character. On these pages, this classic text, placed in three roundels (two on the right page and one at the top of the left page) is followed by that of another early Muslim, Jabir ibn Samura: “I saw the Prophet Muhammad at night wearing a red garment and, as I looked at him and at the moon, he appeared more beautiful than the moon.” Beside the large roundels are twelve smaller ones: the one at upper right is inscribed Allah (God), and the rest contain the names of Muhammad (the Prophet); of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali (the rightly guided caliphs), and of the Prophet’s six companions who first accepted Islam as the true religion. Inscribed in the square enclosures that border the two pages are the ninety-nine names of the Prophet. Both pages are decorated with gilded rulings and freehand floral designs.    The back (verso) of the left-hand page records the patrilineal ancestors of the Prophet, starting with Adnan (122 BCE), arranged in the form of a tree. ?Adnan’s name appears at the base of the trunk and Muhammad’s at the top of the tree, within a domed frame suggestive of an Ottoman mosque. The branches of the tree terminate in ten roundels that contain the names of companions who shared Muhammad’s ancestors. Gold floral designs fill the area beneath the branches. The calligrapher’s name appears at the bottom of the page.    The calligrapher Ismail [bin Ibrahim] Bosnavi (from Bosnia) was the son of Noktaci-zade, the top finance officer (defterdar) of Eger, in Hungary. He received his training at the Ottoman court school for the gifted(enderun), in the seferli division, a teaching center for various arts. Specializing in thuluth and naskh scripts, Isma?il received his calligraphic education and license from Ressam Ömer Efendi. He signed his name Isma?il Muhasib, since after his training at the court school he was sent to the provinces as a bookkeeper (muhasib) of the court eunuchs. He copied a Qur?an on the order of Ahmed III (r. 1703–30) and was generously rewarded. His surviving work consists of individual calligraphic specimens and others contained in albums (muraqqa).    Originally, the hilye text was simply written on paper and carried as a protective amulet. In the last quarter of the seventeenth century, the renowned calligrapher Hafiz Osman transformed it into a circular calligraphic composition and included it in a copy of al-An ?am, the sixth chapter of the Qur?an. With representational images of, for instance, Mecca and Medina, hilyes began to be included in various prayer books that contained Qur?anic chapters and prayers. Believed to bring succor in times of difficulty, such prayer books had widespread public appeal. Hilyes created as independent calligraphic compositions became very popular in Ottoman lands during the nineteenth century, and large-format examples were often hung on the walls of Ottoman houses.           =!=!=Ink, gold and silver on paper=!=!=18th century=!=!=2019-05-07=!=!=226500=!=!=https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:73280_dynmc
