3=!=!=Lodewijk van Schoor=!=!=Allegory of Fall=!=!=This work exemplifies a popular late seventeenth-century tapestry type: hybrid genre-landscapes ("genres mythologiques"), which were usually marketed as sets. A female figure representing Fall is seated on a rocky mound and holds a tall rod with grapevines. While the foreground and sides are framed with sharply rendered foliage and still-life elements, the landscape opens into a soft valley at right. The copper wine vessels, squash, grapes, and apple tree in bloom are all attributes of Fall, as are the five male and female attendant figures bearing the fruits of the season's harvest on silver platters.=!=!=wool and silk=!=!=17th century=!=!=2019-05-04=!=!=157343=!=!=https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:VRS45368_dynmc

The attribution of this mark to Dorothy Grant, the widow of William Grant, has been made by Ian Pickford.  She is recorded as having an apprentice in 1679.

17=!=!=Unknown Artist=!=!=Inlaid Pigeon=!=!=In the Qajar period (1785-1925), steel with gold overlay was used for both decorative and useful items. Many of the decorative steel items of the Qajar period were sculptural shapes with very little precedent in the Islamic world.  The roosters, pigeon and pear displayed here fall into this category.  Only the ewer is a utilitarian object, although it, too, is very sculptural, with a graceful shape characteristic of the Qajar era.

23=!=!=Hak-kyo Chŏng=!=!=Orchids and Rock=!=!=Painted in ink on satin silk, this hanging scroll represents two clumps of orchids, likely cymbidiums, growing on either side of a garden rock. Entering in the lower left corner, the rock rises diagonally through the composition, reaching almost two-thirds the full height of the painting. The orchids grow on either side of the rock. The artist's inscription and signature comprise three columns of calligraphy in the painting's upper right quadrant. The very cursive script and the characters' extended final, vertical brushstrokes harmonize perfectly with the brushwork of the orchids' leaves and flowers. A seal of the artist reading Chŏng Hak-kyo appears immediately after the artist's signature (i.e., at the bottom of the third column of calligraphy, reading from right to left). The artist's second seal appears in the lower left corner of the painting, impressed on the lowest part of the rock.  =!=!=Hanging scroll; ink on satin silk; with signature reading "Chŏng Hak-kyo"; with two seals of the artist=!=!=20th century=!=!=2019-05-04=!=!=357471=!=!=https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:LEG007341_dynmc
